"""
forms.py

This file is where we create forms for user input using Flask-WTF. It's like making a questionnaire. 
Each form class represents a different form on our website (like signup or login). 
We define what fields each form should have (like username, password) and rules for them (like 'required'). 
This helps us easily collect and validate data from users.
