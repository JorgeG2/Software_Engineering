"""
routes.py

This file is the traffic controller of our application. It listens for requests from users 
(like clicking a link or submitting a form) and then tells the application how to respond. 
For each route (URL path), we define a function that creates the page the user sees. 
These functions can pull information from our database, use it to fill out templates, or accept 
user input to create new records in our database.
