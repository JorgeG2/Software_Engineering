# Atlantic Haven Stays 
## Purpose of this Project
This project is focused on developing a practical and user-friendly online system for a local bed and breakfast in Atlantic City, NJ. The goal is to provide the business owner with a straightforward way to handle various aspects of their business online. This includes listing their properties, setting prices, managing reservations, communicating with guests, and tracking finances. The system will also offer a feature for guests to create their own accounts, adding convenience for repeat visits.

We're planning to use a selection of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that are well-suited for building a reliable and efficient system. I'll go into more detail about these choices, explaining how they'll help us meet the project's needs.

Our team is made up of individuals with different skills and roles. From those who are focusing on the visual design and user experience to the ones handling the technical backend development, each member plays a crucial role. I'll break down who's doing what, giving you a clear picture of how our team is working together to bring this project to life.
