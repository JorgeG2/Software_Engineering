## Purpose of this Project
This project is focused on developing a practical and user-friendly online system for a local bed and breakfast in Atlantic City, NJ. The goal is to provide the business owner with a straightforward way to handle various aspects of their business online. This includes listing their properties, setting prices, managing reservations, communicating with guests, and tracking finances. The system will also offer a feature for guests to create their own accounts, adding convenience for repeat visits.

We're planning to use a selection of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that are well-suited for building a reliable and efficient system. I'll go into more detail about these choices, explaining how they'll help us meet the project's needs.

Our team is made up of individuals with different skills and roles. From those who are focusing on the visual design and user experience to the ones handling the technical backend development, each member plays a crucial role. I'll break down who's doing what, giving you a clear picture of how our team is working together to bring this project to life.

### Front End 
- Sangida
- Jetzaly

### Back End 
- Taszid
- Jorge
- Dylan

## Technology Stack
We will utilize a combination of modern programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. This includes:

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (React.js for dynamic user interfaces)

**Backend**: Python (Django or Flask for robust backend services)

**Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL for data management)
Additional tools and libraries will be chosen based on project requirements.

## Team Role and Responsibilities
### Front End Team
**Sangida**:Lead on UI/UX design, responsible for creating visually appealing and intuitive interfaces. Will work closely with Jetzaly to ensure consistent and responsive design across all devices.

**Jetzaly**: Focuses on front-end development, implementing the designs created by Sangida using React.js. Ensures smooth user experience and interactivity.
### Back End Team

**Jorge** : Backend team lead, overseeing the development of server-side logic. Responsible for database integration and ensuring data consistency.

**Taszid** : Specializes in API development, creating endpoints for front-end interaction and third-party integrations if necessary.

**Dylan**: Manages security and data protection, ensuring the system is robust against potential threats. Also works on optimizing server performance.

## Cloning the project 
Here you will clone the github repository 
``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/JorgeG2/Software_Engineering
```

## How to start working on the Project
Virtual Environment will be used to keep track of dependencies, dependencies will be things like frameworks, libraries, versions of programming languages this will be important because when we want to upload our project to a server using either Digital Ocean, Heroku, AWS the server needs to know exactly what we are running so that it can host the site correctly

### Create Virtual Environment
``` Bash
pip3 install virtualenv #This is for python 3 which all of us should have
```
For Windows do the following
``` Bash
env_name\Scripts\activate
```
Next we will name the virtual Environment whatever we want to call it this is not important though

``` Bash
virtualenv env_name  # Replace 'env_name' with your desired environment name
```
